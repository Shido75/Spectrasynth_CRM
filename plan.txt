I understand you want to make UI/UX improvements to the inquiry and product management sections of your frontend application. Let me break down what you're requesting:

## Changes Needed

### 1. Inquiries List Page (`http://localhost:3000/dashboard/Inquiry`)

**UI Modifications:**
- **Remove Delete Button**: Remove the delete action from the Actions column in the inquiries table
- **Column Header Change**: "Customer Name" → "Employee Name" 
- **Column Header Change**: "Days Since Inquiry" → "Date Inquiry"

**Business Logic Impact:**
- This suggests inquiries are now being tracked by employee rather than customer
- Date display preference changed from relative time ("X days ago") to absolute date format

### 2. Product Management Section

**Location**: Likely within the inquiry workflow or product selection interface
**UI Modifications:**
- **Add CAS Number**: Display CAS number field after the product name field
- **Field Reordering**: Move quantity field to appear after the price field

### 3. Product List Page (`http://localhost:3000/dashboard/ProductList`)

**UI Modifications:**
- **Add Quantity Column**: Insert quantity field/column after the price column in the product listing

## What I Understand About Your Requirements

### Frontend Architecture Implications:
- You have a React/frontend application running on port 3000
- The backend API (port 8000) will likely need to support these UI changes
- Table/list components need column reordering and field additions

### Data Model Considerations:
- Employee tracking instead of customer tracking for inquiries
- CAS numbers are important for chemical product identification (fits your pharmaceutical business)
- Quantity management is becoming more prominent in the UI

### User Experience Goals:
- Simplifying inquiry management (removing delete functionality)
- Making chemical product identification easier (CAS numbers)
- Better inventory/quantity visibility

## Frontend Files Likely Affected:
- Inquiry list component/page
- Product management components
- Table/grid components
- Potentially API calls to match new data requirements

Would you like me to help locate the frontend code files and implement these changes? I'll need to explore your frontend directory structure first.




## Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Product List UI Enhancement

### Overview
Enhance the Product List page at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/ProductList` to display additional critical product information (CAS numbers and quantities) in a more user-friendly column arrangement.

## What I Understand

### Current State Analysis
- **Existing Product List**: Currently displays products with basic information including name and price
- **Missing Key Data**: CAS numbers and quantities are not visible in the main product listing
- **User Pain Point**: Users likely need to navigate to individual product details to see CAS numbers and inventory levels

### Business Context
- **Chemical Industry Requirements**: CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) numbers are critical identifiers for chemical products in pharmaceutical/chemical industry
- **Inventory Visibility**: Quantity information is essential for sales and inventory management
- **User Workflow**: Sales team and technical staff need quick access to both chemical identifiers and stock levels

## Requirements

### 1. ProductList Table Enhancement (`/dashboard/ProductList`)

**New Column Structure (Left to Right):**
1. Product Name *(existing)*
2. **CAS Number** *(new column)*
3. Price *(existing)*
4. **Quantity** *(new column)*
5. Other existing columns...

**Data Requirements:**
- **CAS Number Field**: Display chemical CAS registry numbers for product identification
- **Quantity Field**: Show current available stock/inventory quantity
- **Column Headers**: Clear, professional labeling
- **Data Formatting**: Proper alignment and formatting for numerical data

### 2. User Experience Goals

**Improved Information Architecture:**
- Critical product identifiers (CAS) immediately visible after product names
- Inventory levels visible alongside pricing information
- Logical flow: Identity → Chemical ID → Price → Availability

**Business Benefits:**
- Faster product identification for technical inquiries
- Immediate inventory visibility for sales decisions
- Reduced clicks/navigation for common product information
- Better support for chemical industry workflows

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Implementation Needs:
- **Component Updates**: ProductList table/grid component modifications
- **API Integration**: Ensure backend provides CAS and quantity data
- **Responsive Design**: New columns must work on different screen sizes
- **Data Loading**: Handle cases where CAS or quantity data might be missing

### Backend Data Requirements:
- **Product Model**: Verify CAS number and quantity fields exist
- **API Endpoints**: Ensure ProductList API returns complete product data
- **Data Validation**: Proper formatting and validation for CAS numbers

### Data Flow Understanding:
1. **Frontend Request**: ProductList page requests complete product data
2. **Backend Response**: API returns products with name, CAS, price, quantity
3. **UI Rendering**: Table displays data in specified column order
4. **User Interaction**: Users can sort/filter by any column including new ones

## Expected Outcome
A more comprehensive product listing that provides essential chemical product information at a glance, improving workflow efficiency for sales and technical teams working with pharmaceutical/chemical products.

The enhanced table will serve as a central hub for product information without requiring drill-down navigation for basic but critical data points.
