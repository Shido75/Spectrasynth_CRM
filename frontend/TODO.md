# TODO: Fix Edit Link in ViewQuotation

- [ ] Create EditQuotation.jsx component based on CreateQuotation.jsx, modified to load and edit existing quotation data
- [ ] Update App.js to add routes: "quotations/:id" for ViewQuotation and "quotations/:id/edit" for EditQuotation
- [ ] Update links in QuotationManagement.jsx to use /quotations/:id for view and /quotations/:id/edit for edit
- [ ] Update links in ViewQuotation.jsx to use /quotations/:id/edit for edit and /quotations for back
- [ ] Test the navigation to ensure links work correctly
